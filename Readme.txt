Smart Home Automation System 

1) In The Step 1 I and My project patner bought all the components.
2) Then We had to do different functionality implemation in the project.
3) In the 3 step we implement first fuctionality light on-ff using mobile application.
4) Then 2nd functionality implimation is fan on-off using application.
5) 3rd functionality implimation is when tempreature is 32 up then fan automatically fan on and 30 then automatically off.
6) Then light on-off using voice command.
7) 5th functionality implimation is door lock-unlock using solenoid lock.
8) Then we impliment  use servo moter for window open and close via Application.
9) Then we use Submersible Mini water pump for the Plant watering.
10) We create set timer for light on-off using application.
11) Then we made House Model for aal funationality.
12) Then we set all the components in model and set the all process.
13) Then we create application for all functionality.
